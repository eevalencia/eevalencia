- 👋 Hi, I’m @eevalencia - Enrique Valencia
- 👷🏻‍♂️ I am professional in earth sciences and I have 25 years of experience in the exploration and production of hydrocarbons.
- 👀 I’m interested in emerging computing science technologies to be applied to the energy sector.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and developing a project named "Fluxera" which is a Blockchain platform for the volumetric management of fluid natural resources. I am currently working on the concept with special attention to the Oil and Gas, and fluids associated (liquids and gasses).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on both technical aspects of volumetric management of fluids (resources and production) and also on the conceptual and technological aspects to create the blockchain network. I know this project must be developed by a strong team... so, people interested in to contribute and may be to become part of this team is welcome to email me expressing this interest.
- 📫 How to reach me: ev.fluxera@gmail.com
